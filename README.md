# Preliminary Abstract

The Supreme Court of the Philippines (SC), which serves as the
highest court, has always been facing the problem of having case
backlogs. Within a year, 93% of the cases received by the SC are
remaining unresolved. Effective strategy-making of lawyers are
also critical in the litigation process of a case. Overconfidence can
affect the caseâ€™s outcome which can be prevented with an objective
case prediction tool to assist lawyers. In this paper, the researcher
addresses these problems by exploring different NLP-based feature
extraction techniques and determining how it affects the results
of machine learning models. A comparison between bag-of-words
and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), lemma-
tization and stemming, and choice of N-grams are evaluated on
how a specific combination of feature extraction method affect the
Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network Models. The
best performing system (TF-IDF + lemmatization + bigrams + SVM)
achieves an **overall accuracy of 91.80%** and an **F1-score of 95%** when classifying criminal cases into two case decision categories.
